    "**napari** is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python.\n",
    "It's designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional images.\n",
    "It's built on top of `Qt` (for the GUI), `vispy` (for performant GPU-based rendering),\n",
    "and the scientific Python stack (e.g. `numpy`, `scipy`).\n",
    "It includes critical viewer features out-of-the-box,\n",
    "such as support for large multi-dimensional data, and layering and annotation.\n",
    "By integrating closely with the Python ecosystem,\n",
    "**napari** can be easily coupled to leading machine learning and image analysis tools (e.g. `scikit-image`, `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch`),\n",
    "enabling more user-friendly automated analysis.\n"
